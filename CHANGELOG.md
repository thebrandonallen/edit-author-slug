## [1.6.1](https://github.com/thebrandonallen/edit-author-slug/tree/1.6.1) - 2019-09-05
### Changed
* Removes pre-WP 4.5 cache busting. The minimum version has been 4.7 for quite some time, and, as of WP 4.5, the cache busting was redundant.
* Don't show the options page if `ba_eas_can_edit_author_slug()` returns `false`. [GH-21]

### Changed
* Minimum required WordPress version is now 4.7
* Settings page JS no longer depends on jQuery (switched to plain js)

### Deprecated
* Minimum PHP version has been bumped to 5.3. This is a soft bump, meaning, the plugin should still run on PHP 5.2. However, PHP 5.2 is no longer, officially, supported.

## [1.5.2](https://github.com/thebrandonallen/edit-author-slug/tree/1.5.2) - 2017-06-21
### Fixed
* Fixed a regression where those using the default author based couldn't remove front unless they were also using role-based author bases. [GH-12]

## [1.5.1](https://github.com/thebrandonallen/edit-author-slug/tree/1.5.1) - 2017-06-02
### Fixed
* Fixed a PHP notice when manually updating a user profile.

## [1.5.0](https://github.com/thebrandonallen/edit-author-slug/tree/1.5.0) - 2017-05-30
### Added
* Added `CHANGELOG.md` file.
* Introduce `ba_eas_nicename_exists()` to check if a nicename exists.
* Added `LICENSE` file.
* Added `BA_Edit_Author_Slug::VERSION` & `BA_Edit_Author_Slug::DB_VERSION` class constants.

### Changed
* The plugin bootstrap was refactored, and BA_Edit_Author_Slug was moved into `includes/classes/class-ba-edit-author-slug.php`.
* Deprecated functions were moved into `includes/deprecated.php`.
* `ba_eas_can_edit_author_slug()` no longer checks `is_super_admin()`.
* `ba_eas_remove_front()` now checks `ba_eas_has_front()` on top of the `BA_Edit_Author_Slug::remove_front`.
* The `BA_Edit_Author_Slug` class is no longer declared `final`.
* Translations are only loaded from the WP languages folder (ie - wp-content/languages/plugins).
* Bumped minimum required WordPress version to 4.4.

### Deprecated
* Deprecated the `BA_Edit_Author_Slug::version` & `BA_Edit_Author_Slug::db_version` properties.
* Deprecated `ba_eas_get_wp_roles()`. Use `wp_roles()` instead. [GH-9]
* Deprecated `ba_eas_update_nicename_cache()`. Use `wp_cache_delete( $old_nicename, 'userslugs' )` instead. [GH-10]

### Fixed
* Refactored bulk upgrading again. The original fix made things better, but not as good as it could be. This new refactoring drastically improves performance and memory usage.
* Lots of minor optimizations that should improve performance.

### Removed
* Options upgrading/back-compat for pre-0.9 installs was removed. [GH-8]

## [1.4.1](https://github.com/thebrandonallen/edit-author-slug/tree/1.4.1) - 2017-04-24
* Fix failing string replacement in bulk update message.

## [1.4.0](https://github.com/thebrandonallen/edit-author-slug/tree/1.4.0) - 2017-04-04
* Lots of code cleanup to better adhere to WordPress Coding Standards.
* Improved performance of `ba_eas_sanitize_author_base()` by preventing unnecessary processing.
* Fixed an issue where the demo author permalink URL could have a double slash.
* Improvements to bulk update for sites with a large user base.

## [1.3.0](https://github.com/thebrandonallen/edit-author-slug/tree/1.3.0) - 2017-01-25
* Fix a potential bug where a sanitized author base could end up with double forward slashes.
* Introduce the `%ba_eas_author_role%` permalink structure tag. This can be used to customize role-based author bases.
* Bonus: All alternative facts are now free!

## [1.2.1](https://github.com/thebrandonallen/edit-author-slug/tree/1.2.1) - 2016-02-29
* Fixed stupid error where the default user nicename wasn't being properly retrieved from the database. Sorry about that :(
* Unfortunately, some unicorns were lost during the development of this release, but they are a resilient creature.

* Added the ability to use forward slashes in the author base.

* Packaged translations are now removed. Anyone interested in translating the plugin should do so at [Translate WordPress](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/edit-author-slug).
* EXPERIMENTAL: Added the ability to set the author slug to a user's numeric user id. While I have tested this, I can't be sure that no one's site will implode. If all goes well, the experimental tag will be removed in the next major release (or two).

* Fixed loading of translation files. Looks in wp-content/plugins/edit-author-slug/languages. If you're running 3.7+ (and you are... aren't you?), it will fall back to wp-content/languages/plugins if a proper localization can't be found in the edit-author-slug folder.

* Added custom capability to give site admins the ability to add author slug access to other roles.
* Improvements/optimizations to code logic.
